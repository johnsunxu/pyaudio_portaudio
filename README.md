# SoundShare

This is a program for sending the audio output of one device to another device on the same wifi network. As the name suggests the device receiving the audio will run the receiver.py file and the device sending the audio will run the sender.py file. 

# Notes

Make sure your python version is compatible with pyaudio. There will also likely be a loss in audio quality between devices; thus, the target use case for this program is audio calls where sound quality is not as important.
